# Contributing to gif-provider

Thank you for considering contributing to *gif-provider*. Whatever you can contribute - be it a little or a
lot - is more than welcome!

Please note we have a [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), please follow it in all your
interactions with the project and be good to your fellow contributors.

What to do first will differ based on what you want to do:

- If you want to contribute by reporting a bug, make a feature request, or suggest an enhancement, then
[create an issue](https://github.com/jamescallumyoung/gif-provider/issues/new/choose) (and use the correct
template, if possible).

- If you want to help by writing some code, then look at the open issues
[issue](https://github.com/jamescallumyoung/gif-provider/issues). Issues labeled `good first issue` are a
good place to start if you haven't contributed to this project before. Issues that are assigned to
someone are usually not available, so please check the comments.

Please indicate your desire to work on an issue by posting a comment on the issue itself. This helps me
keep an eye on the project and helps avoid any wasted effort. It's also a great place to discuss your
solution and get feedback, as well as being good open source etiquette.

If you need help, tag me (@jamescallumyoung) in your Issue or PR and I'll be happy to help!

Good luck and thanks again!
